# AutoDeployLR-modified

This repository contains a Streamlit app that demonstrates a CRISP-DM workflow for a simple linear regression problem.

Structure:
When creating the app on Streamlit Cloud, set the main file path to:

- `hw1/app.py`

Behavior change: auto-run on parameter change
-------------------------------------------
The app was updated to auto-run the full CRISP-DM flow whenever a parameter changes (no need to press a Run button). If you prefer a manual Run button instead, let me know and I can revert to the previous behavior.
